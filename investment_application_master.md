# Kjøller Application Form - Master Q&A

## 1. The Concept

### Short description (Elevator Pitch)
*Limit: Usually ~150 characters.*

**Option A (Direct):**
> StockPredictorAI is a financial creator economy where analysts establish a verified track record. We validate their accuracy across different timeframes, allowing top performers to monetize their signals via subscriptions.

**Option B (Punchy):**
> A "Meritocratic Marketplace" for financial insights. We track user predictions (Hourly to Yearly), calculate a proven "Average Rating," and automatically distribute profit to the top 1% through our Creator Pool.

### General description
*Limit: Usually ~500-1000 characters.*

> Retail investors struggle to know who to trust. StockPredictorAI solves this by building a transparent platform where **User Performance** is the only metric that matters.
>
> **How it Works:**
> 1.  **Multi-Horizon Predictions:** Users make forecasts across flexible timeframes—from "Hourly" scalps to "Yearly" investments—allowing all trading styles to shine.
> 2.  **The "Average Rating":** We don't just count likes. Every prediction is scored (0-100) based on proximity to the actual closing price. This creates an unforgeable "Reputation Score" for every analyst.
> 3.  **The Creator Pool (Profit Sharing):** We **incentivize excellence** by allocating 50% of platform profits back to the community. Users earn a share of this pool strictly based on their contribution to the platform's total accuracy points.
>
> **Monetization (Golden Membership):**
> Top-rated analysts can unlock "Golden Membership," allowing them to hide their best signals behind a paywall. Other users can then subscribe directly to these experts for exclusive access, creating a true creator economy for financial talent.

## 2. Elaboration & Financials

### What will the money be used for?
> We are seeking investment to transition from a "Bootstrap" phase to a "Growth" phase.
> *   **40% User Acquisition:** Launching targeted campaigns to onboard 50k+ active analysts to populate the leaderboard.
> *   **30% Technical Hiring:** Hiring a Senior Data Scientist to further refine our "Smart Bot" predictive models (improving our B2B data offering).
> *   **30% Infrastructure:** Upgrading from our current Fly.io MVP setup to a dedicated, high-availability cluster capable of handling real-time socket connections for 100k+ concurrent users.

### Who are the current owners?
*Understanding the ownership structure allows us for a better idea on the companys capital structure.*

> **Current Ownership:** 100% owned by **[Your Name]** (Founder).
>
> **Capital Structure:** The company is fully bootstrapped. The cap table is clean with no previous external equity financing, debt, or convertible notes. All IP (codebase, AI models, branding) is fully owned by the company.

### Who has helped to finance the company so far?
*Understanding the investor base provides insights into the company's financial backing and support.*

> **Founder Funded (Bootstrapped).**
> The company has been financed 100% by the founder. No external investors, VCs, or business angels have participated to date.

### What is the company's revenue?
*Please provide a breakdown of the total overall revenue and recent monthly revenues, if possible. Is the revenue generally increasing, decreasing, or stagnant?*

> **Current Status: Pre-Revenue (Growth Phase).**
>
> We are currently in the **"Asset Building" phase**, focusing 100% on acquiring users and prediction data ("Critical Mass") rather than short-term cash flow.
>
> *   **Total Revenue:** $0 (Monetization features are built but currently gated).
> *   **Strategy:** We plan to activate "Golden Memberships" and "Bot Subscriptions" once we reach 5,000 Verified Users, turning the "Revenue Switch" on.
> *   **Trend:** Stagnant by design (Pre-monetization).

### The Ask (Financials)
*   **Seeking (minimum):** `250,000`
*   **Seeking (maximum):** `600,000`
*   **Ownership offered:** `10-15` %
*   **Pre-money valuation:** `2,500,000`
*   **Comment:**
    > **Strategy: Trust First, Revenue Second.**
    > We are raising this round to reach **"Ramen Profitability" ($10k MRR)** and acquire **25,000 Active Users**.
    >
    > *Why this target?*
    > Hitting $10k MRR proves "Product-Market Fit" and makes us ready for a Series A. This Seed capital is purely to fuel that user acquisition engine. We are pricing the round on the *asset value* of the platform, not just current cash flow.
    >
    > We are open to a convertible note or SAFE structure.

## 3. The Problem

### What problem does the company solve with its product?
*Please describe the specific problem that the company's product or service is addressing.*

**The "Crisis of Trust" in Financial Media.**

Retail investors are drowning in noise. Platforms like Twitter/X, Reddit, and Discord are flooded with self-proclaimed "gurus" and anonymously posted stock tips.
1.  **No Accountability:** Influencers delete losing tweets and only promote winners.
2.  **No Track Record:** There is no universal, unforgeable standard to verify if an analyst is actually profitable over time.
3.  **Analysis Paralysis:** Investors don't know who to follow, leading to poor financial decisions based on hype rather than data.

**The Solution:** StockPredictorAI acts as the **"Trust Layer"**. We don't just host content; we *validate* it. By forcing every prediction to be logged, scored, and ranked on an immutable leaderboard, we filter out the noise and surface the top 1% of talent that is actually worth listening to.

## 4. Background

### History / Inspiration
*The question aims to understand the history behind the company and what inspired the founders to start it.*

> The idea for StockPredictorAI was born out of frustration. As an active trader, I saw thousands of retail investors losing money by following "gurus" on Twitter and Reddit who would delete their losing predictions and only show their wins.
>
> I realized the financial internet was missing a "Validation Layer"—a neutral referee.
>
> I built the first version as a personal tool to track my own accuracy. But as I layered in AI to analyze the data, I realized the bigger opportunity: **What if we could index the entire world's financial intelligence?**
>
> What started as a side project to expose fake gurus has evolved into a global platform that empowers the honest ones. We are building the meritocracy that finance has always promised but never delivered.

## Appendix: Revenue Logic

**The Path to $10k MRR (Scenario):**
*   **600** Bot Subscribers ($9/mo) = **$5,400** (100% Margin)
*   **1,300** Human Subscribers ($10/mo) = **$3,900** (30% Margin)
*   **80** Verified Analysts ($9/mo) = **$720** (100% Margin)
*   **Result:** **$10,020 MRR**
